-> Source code: https://github.com/peterMcP/physics2_pinball 

-> Original game: https://www.classicgame.com/game/HotRod+Pinball

-> Differences with the original: 
  No main kicker flipper appendix
  We have some fancy combos 

           Controls:
Arrows
- Left: Left flipper
- Right: Right flipper
- Down: Launch new ball

Debug:
- F1: draw shapes
- Mouse click: drag ball


            COMBOS: 

::Combo 1 -> When you go through the gravity zone
  three times (so you collect three stars), an extra 
  ball is launched from the hole

::Combo 2 -> Every 500000 points, the "vacuum 
  cleaner" launches a set of balls

::Combo 3 -> You can activate all the light sensors
  at the top, and they will restart to give you more
  score

        --- Take into account --- 

_When gravity is available, the arrow with the burn
  logo shines
_When lock functionality is available, the arrow
  with the lock logo shines
