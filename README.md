-> Source code: https://github.com/peterMcP/physics2_pinball 

-> Original game: https://www.classicgame.com/game/HotRod+Pinball

-> Differences with the original: 
  - No main kicker flipper appendix
  - We have some fancy combos
  - Implemented highscore at the end of the game

           Controls:
Arrows
- Left: Left flipper
- Right: Right flipper
- Space: Launch new ball (like the original pinball)
- Return: when game end show highscore, then, restart the game

Debug:
- F1: draw shapes
- Mouse click: drag ball


            COMBOS: 

::Combo 1 -> When you go through the gravity zone
  three times (so you collect three stars), an extra 
  ball is launched from the hole

::Combo 2 -> Every 1.000.000 points, the "vacuum 
  cleaner" launches a set of balls

::Combo 3 -> You can activate all the light sensors
  at the top, and they give you a plus score and after will 
  restart to give you more score

        --- Take into account --- 

_When gravity is available, the arrow with the burn
  logo shines
_When lock functionality is available, the arrow
  with the lock logo shines
